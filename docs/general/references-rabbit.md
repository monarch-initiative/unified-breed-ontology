**Description:**  
DAD-IS is a list compiled and maintained by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). This list contains information on more than 15,000 national breed populations representing more than 8,800 breeds across 38 species. It is assembled, contributed to, and updated by country-nominated National Coordinators from 182 countries.

**Data breeds notes:**  
DAD-IS represents 2 types of breeds: “local breeds” (breeds reported in a single country), and “transboundary breeds” (breeds reported in several different countries). The instance of “transboundary breeds” that are reported in specific countries are called in DAD-IS “national breed populations”
In addition to the breeds' most common name and country of existence, DAD-IS reports on the domestication status, the extinction status of breeds, and the description of origin of the breeds.
